歌ってみた、をやってみたくて。
歌詞備忘録。合ってるかは不明。

When you get yourself me in your head, won’t you let me see your heart?
Get better, do you feel the same and make on you?
Even I won’t roughly get to share if you don’t care for all the man.
Have you ever come here only for the love?

When it’s through the dream here, we are not the same.
When it’s raining in the night, Lady, don’t you treat me bad.

Now it’s through again, feel more than ever,
Then you make me go, and I can’t be hold on.
Now it’s through again, feel more than ever,
Then you make me go and I can be hold on.

When you get yourself me in your head, won’t you let me see your heart?
Get better, do you feel the same and make on you?
Even I won’t roughly get to share if you don’t care for all the man.
Have you ever come here only for the love?

When it’s through the dream here, we are not the same.
When it’s raining in the night, Lady, don’t you treat me bad.

Now it’s through again, feel more than ever,
Then you make me go, and I can’t be hold on.
Now it’s through again, feel more than ever,
Then you let me go, and I can be hold on.

When it’s through the dream here, we are not the same.
When it’s raining in the night, Lady, don’t you treat me bad.

What can I do for your love?
How can I say in the deadly words?
Take me now to your heart!
Drive me down and get away!

What can I do for your love?
How can I say in the deadly words?
Take me now to your heart!
Drive me down and get away!

Now it’s through again, feel more than ever,
Then you make me go, and I can’t be hold on.
Now it’s through again, feel more than ever,
Then you let me go, and I can be hold on.

Now it’s through again, feel more than ever,
Then you make me go, and I can’t be hold on.
Now it’s through again, feel more than ever,
Then you let me go, and I can be hold on.

Now it’s through again, feel more than ever,
Then you make me go, and I can’t be hold on.
Now it’s through again, feel more than ever,
Then you let me go, and I can be hold on.
